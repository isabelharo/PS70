#### Week 5: 3D Design, Printing, Scanning 

This week we learned more about 3D modeling, possibilities for 3D printing, and scanning objects in 3D.

When making my first print with the 3D printer, I of course decided to start by trying to print a cockroach for my elevator. I found an amazing 3D Cockroach model online, and the print took about 9 minutes. The photo of my print is below. The little black spots are because there was some remaining black PLA wire that wasn't properly cleaned before I printed. Unfortunately, I didn't protect my cockroach well enough and, because it has delicate parts printed with only one string of PLA, its antenna broke.

Here is the stl file:

The next thing we learned was how to scan an object in 3D using the Revopoint scanner that we have in the lab. I was curious to see how it would do with my computer mouse, because of its curved shape, ridges, and little buttons. Here are the results!

For the 3D design portion of the week, I decided to design a wearable part of my final project. I wanted to make a bespoke hard necklace, so that I can attach two contact microphones on each side of the throat for hands-free contact mic use.
