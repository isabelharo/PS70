#### Week 6 and 7: Electronic Input and Output Devices 

For electronic input and output weeks, I decided to start working on the contact mic for my final project. I know that most DIY contact mics are made with piezo sensors, so I decided to focus on them and and how they interact with MCUs.

But first, I started by following Nathan's basic tutorial for sensing with step-response, aka transmit-receive or tx-rx. I made a very basic force sensor!

Then, to start getting to know piezo sensors , I used the Arduino example sketch Knock, which uses a piezo element to detect a knocking sound. The circuit is very basic -- with the piezo and a 1 MOhm resistor connect in parallel to pin A0 on the Arduino and to Ground. Interestingly, I learned that changing the value of the resistor affects the sensitivity of the sensor -- a greater resistance makes it more sensitive, and a smaller one makes it less sensitive.

I did a very poor job of soldering the piezo to red and grey wires to extend them -- but I was glad I did it because having longer wires made building the circuit much easier.

Then, I decided to try to use the same piezo sensor, except as an output, because I learned that they can be both inputs and outputs!

The wiring was super simple -- I just connected my piezo to pin 8 of the Arduino and to ground. To make the piezo make sound, I used the Arduino example sketch toneMelody. The piezo became a little speaker!

The piezo component is probably my favorite electronic component I've ever encountered -- I love how sensitive it is when paired with a large resistor, and the fact that it can be used for both input and output functions.
